// Tech Tree File
// Defines the requirements for being able to buy certain building/unit/upgrade

// About Building Creation & Builder Abilities
	// These abilities will show on the builder at all times, but as a disabled version that states the requirements if some of them aren't met.
	// Every time a building is destroyed the table for the player gets updated, and a script is called to verify every requirement on builders & buildings
	// Requirements aren't recursive, meaning if A is req for B and B is a req for C, destroying A won't make you unable to build C as long as B is up.

// About Technology Upgrades - Building abilities - Research
	// Destroying the building doesn't remove the upgrade, these are permanent until the game ends
	// Having the previous upgrade is not a requirement, as lvl 2-3 tech will only appear on the building whenever the first one is acquired
	// Tech Upgrade abilities are hidden once they are researched (and should be hidden on every building that has access to such research)
	// Each time a unit spawns it should check for its upgrades. Each time an upgrade is finished, it should go through all the units and apply it.
